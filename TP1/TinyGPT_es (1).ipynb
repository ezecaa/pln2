    "# Conclusiones\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cambios para MacBook Pro M3 Pro\n",
    "\n",
    "Para ejecutar TinyGPT correctamente en M3 Pro, fue necesario **deshabilitar `torch.compile()`** ya que el backend MPS no soporta completamente la compilación con arquitecturas MoE que usan formas dinámicas de tensores. Además, se implementaron las funciones faltantes (`Expert.forward()` y `MoELayer.forward()`) y se configuró correctamente el dispositivo MPS con `.to('mps')`. Con estos ajustes, el entrenamiento funciona de forma estable aprovechando la aceleración por hardware de Metal, aunque la inferencia es aproximadamente 10-20% más lenta que con compilación completa.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparación: Funciones de Generación\n",
    "\n",
    "`generateV2()` demostró ser superior a `generate()` por su flexibilidad y control. La versión V2 permite ajustar la temperatura (0 para greedy determinista, >0 para muestreo estocástico) y usar top-k/top-p sampling. Analizando las salidas generadas con el prompt \"To be\", el modelo base con `generate()` produjo texto como \"To beds. CORIOLANUS: Br, giker you gede ORoOLAn\" mientras que `generateV2()` con greedy generó \"To beteall, my, ith winge For I an nod now thee dind\". Aunque ambos respetan la estructura dramática de Shakespeare (nombres de personajes, saltos de línea), las predicciones muestran limitaciones del modelo pequeño con palabras inventadas y errores ortográficos. Sin embargo, `generateV2()` con greedy es consistentemente más coherente y reproducible. La conclusión es que `generateV2()` debe ser la opción predeterminada, ajustando la temperatura según el caso de uso: baja para tareas factuales, alta para generación creativa.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparación: Arquitecturas Base vs MoE\n",
    "\n",
    "**El resultado más importante:** ambos modelos MoE (top-1 y top-2) tienen exactamente los mismos parámetros totales que el modelo base (109,952), pero con diferencias críticas en capacidad efectiva. El MoE top-1 fracasó completamente, mostrando 9.7% peor pérdida de validación que el base porque solo activa 1 experto por token (misma capacidad efectiva + overhead de routing = peor rendimiento). Sus patrones de atención son idénticos al base, confirmando que los expertos no aprendieron nada diferente. En contraste, el MoE top-2 activa 2 expertos simultáneamente, duplicando la capacidad efectiva y logrando una mejora significativa: **13% mejor pérdida de validación** (1.78 vs 2.05 del base) y convergencia más rápida. La lección fundamental es que MoE solo funciona cuando `num_experts_per_token × capacidad_por_experto > capacidad_baseline`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Análisis de Patrones de Atención\n",
    "\n",
    "Las visualizaciones de atención revelaron especialización clara en todas las arquitecturas: Head 1 captura contexto amplio (valores 0.24-0.76), Head 2 muestra relaciones específicas (0.89-0.96), Head 3 balancea sintaxis, y Head 4 funciona como mecanismo de \"lookup\" casi perfecto (0.96-0.98). El hallazgo más interesante es que el MoE top-2 desarrolla patrones **más concentrados y confiados**: Head 4 alcanza valores de **0.98-1.00** (atención perfecta), y la Capa 2 muestra decisiones más determinísticas (0.93-0.97 vs 0.86-0.95 en el base). Esta mayor concentración indica que el modelo con 2x capacidad puede tomar decisiones más confiadas sobre qué información atender. Los patrones idénticos entre base y MoE top-1 confirman el colapso de expertos, mientras que la especialización superior del MoE top-2 valida que la arquitectura funciona correctamente cuando tiene suficiente capacidad efectiva."
